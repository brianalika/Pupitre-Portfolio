            <p>
              As the son and grandson of Mexican fieldworkers who first came to the US without an education, Brian made an early decision in his career to ensure that individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have access to a quality education.
            <p>
            </p>
              With more than a decade of global experience, Brian has worked across the world developing training and leadership development programs for young educators. As technology continues to become quotidian in today's modern world, Brian aspires to weave together his passion for education with his newfound skill set in coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, Brian is a Managing Director with Teacher For America and is enrolled in a coding boot camp through the University of Denver. He possesses a Master’s in International Educational Development from Columbia University and he received his teaching credentials from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. Brian graduated cum laude from Pepperdine University with a Bachelor’s degree in International Studies with a double minor in Spanish and French.

            </p>
            <p>
              In the fall of 2019, Brian hopes to pursue a doctoral degree within the field of Instructional Technology. His research will focus on how mobile technology can be leveraged in order to improve the educational outcomes for students in developing contexts.
